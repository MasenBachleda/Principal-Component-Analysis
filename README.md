# Principal-Component-Analysis
This is a principal component analysis I conducted in R. 
After removing categorical data and removing records with missing data, I conducted a PCA and found that 57.4% of the variation can be explained by the first two principal components.
This is useful in determining whether or not we can reduce the dimensionality of the data set. 
It is up to the user to figure how much variation they want explained by the principal components. For example, 88% of the variation can be explained by the first 8 PC's.
